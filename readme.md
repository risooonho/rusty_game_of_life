# Game of life

A Game of life implementation that can render in CLI as well as in a GUI window. This is mainly to learn and practice my Rust skills.

## Setup

- Install rust if you already haven't: <https://rustup.rs/.>
- Clone this repo.
- run `cargo run` in the repo directory to build and run the code.
